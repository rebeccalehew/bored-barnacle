## Description:

The Team Profile Generator app is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## Installation:
This app requires the use of the Inquirer package. To ensure that you install and use Inquirer version 8.2.4, use the following command in your project folder CLI: `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`. Now that you have inquirer available, let's prepare the node environment:
1. Download the source code.
2. Open up the command line and run `npm install`.
3. In the command line, run `npm start` to start the inquirer prompts.
4. Answer the prompts to have a simple, tidy team profile created off of your input!

## Usage:
Below is the User Story highlighting the reasons why this app is needed. 

User Story:
```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```
This Node.js command-line application takes in formation about employees and creates an HTML webpage that displays summaries over each team member. This puts information about a team in one central location, making the lives of managers around the world much easier!

## Challenges:
I struggled with passing the correct arguments into the many functions to get this app running as expected. Through trial and error, reading documentation, and reviewing working apps, I was able to debug my app and achieve functionality! 

Writing tests is also a challenge. At this time, no unit tests have been written to double check the code. This is something I will continue to read documentation over and develop tests at a later date.

## Contributions:
This app was created in conjuction with the coding boot camp program at the University of Kansas. Please contact me, Rebecca, directly for guidelines.
